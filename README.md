This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores different techniques for building and training a neural network to recognize handwritten German digits. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of a basic neural network, Nesterov momentum for gradient descent, and dropout regularization, comparing their effects on training and validation loss, as well as overall model accuracy.
